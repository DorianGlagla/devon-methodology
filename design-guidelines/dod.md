# Definition of done
As a part of the methodology proposal, any item in the backlog that is a user story, is considered as done if the following criteria is satisfied:

1. **Code is peer-reviewed**

    - The code should be reviewed by one or more people with a similar competence as the developer.

2. **Code is deployed to test environment**

    - The back-end and front-end code is properly deployed to a test environment. 

3. **Feature is tested against acceptance criteria**

    - The feature fulfills the acceptance criteria completely.

4. **Feature passes regression testing**

    - The developer and UX designer must verify that every feature, which was previously developed and tested, still performs correctly after it was changed or interfaced with other feature.

5. **Feature passes smoke test**

    - The developer must verify that a new developed feature passes a preliminary test in order to check if the most important functions of every component work correctly. This can be performed with *unit tests*.  

6. **Feature is documented**

    - The feature must be properly documented according to the task requirements. 

7. **Feature ok-ed by UX designer**

    - The UX designer must approve the feature and its functionality.

8. **Feature ok-ed by Product Owner**

    - The Product Owner must approve the feature and its functionality. 

## The evolving Definition of Done

This Definition of Done **should not remain the same throughout the lifetime of the project**. As the team becomes more effective and productive, as the developers learn to work better together, they could and should enhance and refine their definition of done to produce more valuable and better quality features. They will recognize patterns in the processes and procedures that are required to produce high quality features and start adding these to the DoD.

This refinement should be discussed in the **retrospective meetings** after each sprint.
