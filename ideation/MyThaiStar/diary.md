# Diary Ideation

This diary explains what happened when and which decisions were taken during the project

## 17.10.2016: Kickoff Offenbach 
'Jens, Christian, Marco, Thorsten'

What happened?
Design thinking light:
- Brainstorming about Question "How might we show to whom? with our digital example the strength of our iCSD-platform / community?"
- Ideation results in three main use cases: Invite friend, digital menu, rate by twitter
- First sketching for screens
- First rough user story map
- Results/Work has been captured afterwards in realtimenboard (find link in [GIT]).

Decisions:
 - make the example more digital following SMACT: should work on mobile devices, dashboard might include some analytics, social by twitter integration and social logins, IoT is omitted)
 - example should be easy, should follow KISS (keep it small and simple), easy to understand
 - domain of example should be independent from industry sector -> stick to the restaurant example
 - example is mainly for cap-employees in order to learn devon and start quickly. The implementation (code) of the example should include serveral best practises.
 - payment should not be included
 - reporting: dashboard for chief (e.g. daily reports, twitter review) shall exist, but postponed for later release
 - participating roles in the example:
   - customer is the new role in the center. use cases should be built for this role.
   - the role cook and waiter are removed
   - main operational entities are order and table bookings
   - chief does still exist for dashboard

## After 17.10.2016: Developing of personas, scenarios, prototype plus user story map (Jens, Sebastian)
For each main use case first personas and scenarios and first screens (wireframes) are defined based on previous, rough user story map. Outcome of discussion is used to refine user story map and to finalize the scenarios.
Outcome: Axure Prototype with Screens, Scenarios, User Story Map

## 07.12.2016: Pablo Javier Martinez Calvo and Jaime Moncho Llorca create first Visual Design (color, layout, pictures)

Starting from first mockups Pablo and Jaime create first Axure prototype with visual design. Afterwards Jens incorporates the current state of the scenarios.

Further changes:  
- Changed primary color from blue to green
- removed visual selection of table (out of scope)
- some layout changes (moved filter from left to top, added order-basket directly on main page)

## 22.12.2016: Review before Christmas (Jens, Christian, Marco, Thorsten, Rainer)

Jens presents scenarios and prototype: Everyone is satisfied with solution :-)

except:

- Minor changes in layout and color.
- Filter:
  - Layout of filter should be changed
  - filter should exist, only a few filter criteria are enough in order to show how to implement a filter
  - sorting should be included
- switching of languages added
- login (only username and password) required, no maintainance of user profile needed so far


## 05.01.2017: Coverpage to shape the common visison
In order to shape a shared vision for the example Jens creates a cover page (see [GIT]) representing his understanding of the vision.

## 06.01.2017: Mobile first?
Lukas Birn and Florian Bemm start developing screens following mobile first approach.
