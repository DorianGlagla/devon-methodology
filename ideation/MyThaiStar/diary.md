# Diary Ideation

This diary explains what happend when and whcih decisions were taken during the project

## Kickoff Offenbach (*Jens, Christian, Marco, Thorsten*)

What happend?
Design thinking light:
- Brainsorming about Question
- Ideation resulting in three main use cases: Invite friend, digital menu, rate by twitter
- First sketching for screens
- First rough user story map
- Results has been captured in realtimenboard

Decisions: 
 - make the example more digital following SMACT: should work on mobile devices, dashbaord might include some analytics, social by twitter integration and social logins, IoT is omitted)
 - example should be easy, should follow KISS (keep it small and simple), easy to understand
 - domain of example should be independent from industry sector -> stick to the restaurant example 
 - example is mainly for cap-employess in order to learn devon and start quickly. The implemention of the example should include serveral best practises.
 - payment should not be included
 - reporting: dashboard for chief (e.g. daily reports, twitter review) shall exisit, but postponed for later release
 - participating roles in the example:
 -- customer is the new role in the center. use cases should be built for this role. 
 -- the role cook and waiter are removed
 -- main operational entities are order and table bookings
 -- chief does still exist for dashboard
 
## Review before Christmas (*Jens, Christian, Marco, Thorsten, Rainer*)

Everyone is satisfied by solution.

- Minor changes in layout
- Layout of filter should be changed
- filter should exist, sorting should be included, only few filter criteria are enough in order to show how to do it
