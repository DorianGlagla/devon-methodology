#SC: Susan evaluates the dinner
At 10 p.m. I noticed a new email sent by the system asking me to evaluate the dinner event yesterday. I really enjoyed the evening with my dear friends and the meal was great! I click on the link in the email which opens a screen showing the twitter post of the restaurant for my dish, indicated by the hashtag #mythaistar_pad_thai. First, I read the describiton done by the restaurant and afterwards all comments by other guest. I also see that 12 people before has liked this dish before. Oh, I am not the only one who loves it. As I would like to add comment as well, I first log in to twitter. After that the comment field is shown. I add my comment and press send. Done. Now everyone can read my comment for this dish. As I realy like it yesterday I also press the heart. It switches to read and now 13 people have liked it. As Bob told my yesterday, this dish is will be shown to me the next time in the digital menu, when I select "My Favorites" in the filter. Nice feature because next time I can just choose one dish of my favorites.
