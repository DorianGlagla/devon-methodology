#SC: Susan invites friend to the dinner
Once I created the appointment I enter the overview page to this dinner event. Since I created this event I am able to invite friends by sharing this event with them. So, I invited Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Benedikt and Ernesto to the dinner by entering their email addresses in a form field. The system automatically sends invitations to my invited friends. After that I see a new section labelled as "Who is going" on the overview page. This section helps me to keep track of the confirmations.

At 4 p.m. I noticed that I received several emails regarding my invitation to the dinner. I open the web app and enter the overview page to the dinner event. I see that Hugo, Paula and Benedikt accepted my invitation but Ernesto refused. I furher notive that Martin did not respond so I send him a reminder. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 6 p.m. the invitaion closed and I decided to check if Martin responded. I open the web app again and enter the overview page. To my surprise not only Martin sent me a confirmation but Ernesto changed his mind as well. Nice, we will be 7 people. This will be fun!


#SC: Martin receives invitation to dinner (no response)
It's already 3 p.m. and I did not each much today. Some snacks and a coffee. And checking my schedule it does not seem better towards the end of this day. I'll check my emails, maybe my friends come to the rescue. Nice, Susan invited me to dinner at her favorite restaurant. This sounds great! But oh no I am not sure if I can be there on time. Maybe I can rearrange a meeting and then I will answer this invite later. 

At 4 p.m. I noticed a new email from Susan. She sent me a reminder. Oh I forgot to RSVP! Let me do it now. I follow the link in the mail to open the web app. Here I confirm my attendence by clicking on a button. After clicking the button, the system shows me the menu and I order Nam Tok. After that I successfuly confirmed my attendance and the system shows me a barcode for my order.  


#SC: Ernesto receives invitation to dinner (refused, changed his mind)
At 2 p.m I noticed an email from Susan. She invited me to a dinner this evening. This sounds great! Sadly, I cannot join today. Should I call her? There is a link in the invitation and I click on it. The web app opens and I set my RSVP to "No, I won't go".

It's 5:45 p.m. already and I do not know if I can still join the dinner. There was this overview page in the web app. Maybe I can still change my RSVP. I open the overwiev page of the dinner event and notice that the invitation is still open and I can change my RSVP as well! But I need to hurry as the invitation closes in 15 minutes. I click on teh button to change my RSVP. In order to cinfirm my attendence I need to order a menu first. Mhm... I dot not have time to search through the menu. Luckily the systems recommends ordering Nam Tok because my friends ordered it as well. Since this is a very fast way to order I decided to eat the same. After that I successfuly confirmed my attendance and the system shows me a barcode for my order.
