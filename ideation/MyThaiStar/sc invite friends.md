##SC: invite friends

###Susan's invite
Hi,

my name is Susan and I am 32 years old.

I love to enjoy great food. Especially with my best friends. 

Unfortunately, we are all quite busy – our jobs, friends, sports and so on - and so it is quite hard to schedule dinner with my friends. 

Now I am very happy because my favorite restaurant ThaiStar offers a new online feature. I can not only book a table online, now I can invite my friends just by entering their email-addresses and afterwards the system books the right table for me – depending on the feedback of my friends. With this solution I have not to talk to all my friends before. 

But anyway, do not talks about it, use it. Today is a good day for the ThaiStar.

I open the web app and go to book table. I enter the today’s date and 7 p.m. as time. After that I enter the email address of Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Peter, Benedikt and Ernesto. By clicking on Invite the system sent mails to each of them with my invitation. I receive a confirmation of it.  I have agreed with my friends during our last dinner that all of us book their menu before online – just to avoid loosing time; at 7p.m. we are all very hungry usually. Due to this I confirm the question after my booking of the table whether I would like to book my menu in the next step. The system shows the menu and I order my favorite dinner Nam Tok with Tofu. After that I am done and the system show a barcode for my order. 

At 2 p.m. I receive a mail that Hugo has accepted my invitation, later at 15 p.m. I got the mail that Ernesto will not join. Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. I receive mails about Paula and Martin confirmation. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 18:50 when arriving at the restaurant I show the barcode I received earlier to the waiter. I am not sure why but I guess they check all our arrivals with it. Why? After we all have arrived, the dinner is served always in less than 10 Minutes after the latest guest has arrived. The waiter shows me our table. It is perfect, just suitable for four people.  

I love this service.

###SC: Martin receives invitation to dinner
It's already 3 p.m. and I did not each much today. Some snacks and a coffee. And checking my schedule it does not seem better towards the end of this day. I'll check my emails, maybe my friends come to the rescue. Nice, Susan invited me to dinner at her favorite restaurant. This sounds great! But oh no I am not sure if I can be there on time. Maybe I can rearrange a meeting and then I will answer this invite later. But first, I decline the dinner. 

At 4 p.m. all my work is done. Now I am sure that I can make it. I open the mail with the invite again and follow the link in the mail to open the web app. Here I confirm my attendence by clicking on a button. After clicking the button, the system shows me the menu and I order Nam Tok. After that I successfuly confirmed my attendance and the system shows me a barcode for my order.

###SC: Susan invites friend to the dinner
Once I created the appointment I enter the overview page to this dinner event. Since I created this event I am able to invite friends by sharing this event with them. So, I invited Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Benedikt and Ernesto to the dinner by entering their email addresses in a form field. The system automatically sends invitations to my invited friends. After that I see a new section labelled as "Who is going" on the overview page. This section helps me to keep track of the confirmations.

At 4 p.m. I noticed that I received several emails regarding my invitation to the dinner. I open the web app and enter the overview page to the dinner event. I see that Hugo, Paula and Benedikt accepted my invitation but Ernesto refused. I furher notive that Martin did not respond so I send him a reminder. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 6 p.m. the invitaion closed and I decided to check if Martin responded. I open the web app again and enter the overview page. To my surprise not only Martin sent me a confirmation but Ernesto changed his mind as well. Nice, we will be 7 people. This will be fun!


###SC: Ernesto receives invitation to dinner (refused, changed his mind)
At 2 p.m I noticed an email from Susan. She invited me to a dinner this evening. This sounds great! Sadly, I cannot join today. Should I call her? There is a link in the invitation and I click on it. The web app opens and I set my RSVP to "No, I won't go".

It's 5:45 p.m. already and I do not know if I can still join the dinner. There was this overview page in the web app. Maybe I can still change my RSVP. I open the overwiev page of the dinner event and notice that the invitation is still open and I can change my RSVP as well! But I need to hurry as the invitation closes in 15 minutes. I click on teh button to change my RSVP. In order to cinfirm my attendence I need to order a menu first. Mhm... I dot not have time to search through the menu. Luckily the systems recommends ordering Nam Tok because my friends ordered it as well. Since this is a very fast way to order I decided to eat the same. After that I successfuly confirmed my attendance and the system shows me a barcode for my order.
