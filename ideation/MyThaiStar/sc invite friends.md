##SC: invite friends

###Susan's invite
Hi,

my name is Susan and I am 32 years old.

I love to enjoy great food. Especially with my best friends. 

Unfortunately, we are all quite busy – our jobs, friends, sports and so on - and so it is quite hard to schedule dinner with my friends. 

Now I am very happy because my favorite restaurant ThaiStar offers a new online feature. I can not only book a table online, now I can invite my friends just by entering their email-addresses and afterwards the system books the right table for me – depending on the feedback of my friends. With this solution I have not to talk to all my friends before. 

But anyway, do not talks about it, use it. Today is a good day for the ThaiStar.

I open the web app and go to book table. I enter the today’s date and 7 p.m. as time. After that I enter the email address of Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Peter, Benedikt and Ernesto. By clicking on Invite the system sent mails to each of them with my invitation. I receive a confirmation of it and the barcode for my invite. When I show this barcaode to the restaurant staff, the restaurant knows that I am the organizer of this event. I have agreed with my friends during our last dinner that all of us book their menu before online – just to avoid loosing time; at 7p.m. we are all very hungry usually. Due to this I confirm the question after my booking of the table whether I would like to book my menu in the next step. The system shows the menu and I order my favorite dinner Nam Tok with Tofu. After that I am done and the system shows the barcode for my order. This barcode identifies still my event but now also my order is attached to this id. 

At 2 p.m. I receive a mail that Hugo has accepted my invitation, later at 15 p.m. I got the mail that Ernesto will not join. Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. I receive mails about Paula and Martin confirmation. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 18:50 when arriving at the restaurant I show the barcode I received earlier to the waiter. Why? After we all have arrived, the dinner is served always in less than 10 Minutes after the latest guest has arrived. The waiter shows me our table. It is perfect, just suitable for four people.  

I love this service.

###SC: Martin receives invitation to dinner
It's already 3 p.m. and I did not each much today. Some snacks and a coffee. And checking my schedule it does not seem better towards the end of this day. I'll check my emails, maybe my friends come to the rescue me. Nice, Susan invited me to dinner at her favorite restaurant. This sounds great! But oh no I am not sure if I can be there on time. Maybe I can rearrange a meeting and then I will answer this invite later. 

At 4 p.m. all my work is done. Now I am sure that I can make it. I open the mail with the invite again and follow the link in the mail to open the web app. Here I confirm my attendence by clicking on a button. After clicking the button, the system shows me the menu. Today I am not sure what to order. I only know that I like noodles today. Hence, I press the noodles button in order to see only dished with noodles. Afterwards I press the my favorite Button. The menu shows afterwards all the dinners I have liked at twitter before - indicated by the red twitter heart next to the dishes. After checking this list with the result, nothing found, I decide to try something new. I will trust the opinion of others. For that I change the filter for the likes to a minimum of 10. Now I only see the dishes which a miminum of 10 people have liked before. I browse through the comments and as I read comments like "awesome" and "best in town" the dish Pad Kee Mao sounds interessting for me. I will take it. As I like pork and spicy, I first add pork by pressing the pork button and then enter a short comment "please, make it spicy" to my dish. This time I also would like to order a dessert. For that I select the dessert button. The first dish is the sweet banana. I always take it. I add it and I am done. I check the price of 12,50 € and order my menu. After confirming it the system shows a short summary and a barcode refering to my order.  

Looking forward to got there. But, first back to work. Somethings needs to be done.

###SC: Susan invites friend to the dinner
Once I created the appointment I enter the overview page to this dinner event. Since I created this event I am able to invite friends by sharing this event with them. So, I invited Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Benedikt and Ernesto to the dinner by entering their email addresses in a form field. The system automatically sends invitations to my invited friends. After that I see a new section labelled as "Who is going" on the overview page. This section helps me to keep track of the confirmations.

At 4 p.m. I noticed that I received several emails regarding my invitation to the dinner. I open the web app and enter the overview page to the dinner event. I see that Hugo, Paula and Benedikt accepted my invitation but Ernesto refused. I furher notive that Martin did not respond so I send him a reminder. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 6 p.m. the invitaion closed and I decided to check if Martin responded. I open the web app again and enter the overview page. To my surprise not only Martin sent me a confirmation but Ernesto changed his mind as well. Nice, we will be 7 people. This will be fun!


###SC: Ernesto receives invitation to dinner (refused, changed his mind)
At 2 p.m I noticed an email from Susan. She invited me to a dinner this evening. This sounds great! Sadly, I cannot join today. Should I call her? There is a link in the invitation and I click on it. The web app opens and I set my RSVP to "No, I won't go".

It's 5:45 p.m. already and I do not know if I can still join the dinner. There was this overview page in the web app. Maybe I can still change my RSVP. I open the overwiev page of the dinner event and notice that the invitation is still open and I can change my RSVP as well! But I need to hurry as the invitation closes in 15 minutes. I click on teh button to change my RSVP. In order to cinfirm my attendence I need to order a menu first. Mhm... I dot not have time to search through the menu. Luckily the systems recommends ordering Nam Tok because my friends ordered it as well. Since this is a very fast way to order I decided to eat the same. After that I successfuly confirmed my attendance and the system shows me a barcode for my order.
