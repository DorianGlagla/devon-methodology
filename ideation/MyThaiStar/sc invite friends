Hi,

my name is Susan and I am 32 years old.

I love to enjoy great food. Especially with my best friends. 

Unfortunately, we are all quite busy – our jobs, friends, sports and so on - and so it is quite hard to schedule dinner with my friends. 

Now I am very happy because my favorite restaurant ThaiStar offers a new online feature. I can not only book a table online, now I can invite my friends just by entering their email-addresses and afterwards the system books the right table for me – depending on the feedback of my friends. With this solution I have not to talk to all my friends before. 

But anyway, do not talks about it, use it. Today is a good day for the ThaiStar.

I open the web app and go to book table. I enter the today’s date and 7 p.m. as time. After that I enter the email address of Hugo, Stephanie, Martin, Paula, Peter, Benedikt and Ernesto. By clicking on Invite the system sent mails to each of them with my invitation. I receive a confirmation of it.  I have agreed with my friends during our last dinner that all of us book their menu before online – just to avoid loosing time; at 7p.m. we are all very hungry usually. Due to this I confirm the question after my booking of the table whether I would like to book my menu in the next step. The system shows the menu and I order my favorite dinner Nam Tok with Tofu. After that I am done and the system show a barcode for my order. 

At 2 p.m. I receive a mail that Hugo has accepted my invitation, later at 15 p.m. I got the mail that Ernesto will not join. Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. I receive mails about Paula and Benedikt confirmation. Nice, we will be at least 4 people. 

At 18:50 when arriving at the restaurant I show the barcode I received earlier to the waiter. I am not sure why but I guess they check all our arrivals with it. Why? After we all have arrived, the dinner is served always in less than 10 Minutes after the latest guest has arrived. The waiter shows me our table. It is perfect, just suitable for four people.  

I love this service. 

Susan
