#SC: Susan evaluates the dinner
At 10 p.m. I noticed a new email sent by the system asking me to evaluate the dinner event. I really enjoyed the evening with my dear friends and the meal was great! I click on the link in the email which opens a detail view of the meal I ordered in the web app. By liking the meal and/or writing a comment I can share my experience with others. The meal was great and I decide to like my meal. By clicking on the like button a new window pops up where I can login to Twitter. After logging in, my like is registered. Lee the owner of ThaiStar was there as well and treated us so well. He even offered us additional drinks for free. His service was great and I want to let other people know. Therefore, I write a review.
