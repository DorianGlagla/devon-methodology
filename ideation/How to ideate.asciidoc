# Establish Goals and Vision or Ideation:

In this section actions and tools are described how to come up with a certain goal and vision.
Choosing the right tools depends on how sophisticated the visions and ideas are already: do we have only a rough idea, is the vision already defined and approved by everybody involved in the project?

In case the goals and visions are only roughly defined and quite open approaches like Design Thinking or Googles Design Sprints should be choosen.
Most of the follwoing tools are assigned to a certain phase. Although the application of most of them in other phases can makes sense as well. It realy depends on the situation, area and setup of our projects.

Remark:
1.) All tools and actions are more powerful when appraoched by multiple people together - and not on your own. This can be done in workshops or by sharing and pushing people to get feedback.
2.) For all tools and actions it makes sense to follow a simple cycle: diverge and converge. What does it mean: use the diverge phase to open your mind, create new ideas, think loud. After that converge all your input together and filter all your input by considering the importance, the applicability or by simple summarizing.
3.) all is a iterative process: In case you think it makes sense to repeat a task or redefine prior results, do it!

#### Team
Find a heterogeneous team: Product Owner, Engagement Manager, Tester, Developer, Business Analyst, Customer, people from outside (other projects, similar projects)

### Set the stage
Try to get as much information (by interviewing, observation, do it on you own, ask any export) about the topic, people, project and problems - just collect it.
Define a Context Diagram (see the good old Structered System Analysis) or a Stakeholder Map to cover all aspects of involved systems and people.
In case the idea is only defined roughly, setting up a Contextual Map (see xxx) also makes sense. At this stage the diverge phase shall be quite long and open in order to gather most of it. This can be done by simple brainstorming followins some rules:
- one conversation at a time
- encourage wild ideas
- defer judgement
- go for quantity
- build on the ideas of others
- be visual by using pen and paper
- Do not judge! Support by „yes, and…“ and avoid "but..."
- Mistakes are allowed!

#### Start with How-Might-We-Question (HMW)

A HMW-question is a question following a easy structure. It just asks How might we ... solve a situation or how to improve something or how to.... This question is quite short and powerful but quite hard to define. The reason for is that is is quite hard
to find an appropriate balance between open and focused. It should not be to narrow (because then you miss something) and not to wide (because than you might drive away and are not focused on the real topic). But be patient, you can change it during the process and with the help of your team.

Depends on whether a certain problem is already given and known or not: In case not the question is much more open.
The output of this phase should be identification of a problem for that you'll find a solution or in case the problem is given, to ask whether it is the real problem. Do this by summarizing your results:

Examples:

Use the input from the prior actions and try to narrow it down to be more specific. Try to consider only the important stakesholder or systems or technology. In order to be sure to be on track, ask for feedback about your question as often as possible.

After the first definition of this questions it is not your job, to answer is right away. Instead, we should again diverge at this stage. This can be done quite easy by picking the most important nouns and verbs of your question, underline them and to again some brainstorming about those terms.

After the brainstorming cluster the results in groups, like constraints, objectives, technology, customer, .... Afterwards add prios and remove nonsense - always by consens in your group.



Have you find „a real problem“, „The problem!“. Good ideas need always a problem to solve. In case you got it, take it and find a solution for this problem.
In case an idea pops up in your head, try to identify the problem for this idea. Is it a real problem? Discuss it in your group.
For all identified problems it makes sense to challenge them: makes use of the 5-whys: Try to find the real problem behind the problem....

After finding a problme try to find a solution for it.
In order to *embellish your idea* create a persona with/or empathy map for a person who owns the problem.

Make use of the following methods to diverge again:
  -	Brainstorming
  -	Power of ten: Exaggerate and go underneath?
  -	Pessimist vs optimist: Start a conservation between optimist and pessimist.
  -	Randomnes: take your topic plus any other, random thing/object. Describe "thing" with adjectives or associations, combine them together to your topic
  -	Set constraints: Wie würde das die Konkurennz machen? Was wäre wenn wir in der Küche sind? Was würde Superman machen? Wir haben unendlich Geld?
  -	Distribution: what ...happens ...in case (not)....
  -	As-Is Personas plus As-Is User journey

Try to find ideas and soultion by drawing first prototypes on paper or by creating and visualizing storyboard which explains the solution step after step in a narrative way.
In case you group is big enough apply SAP Design Studio where seperated groups design idea on their own which are presented shortly to each other. Afterwards each group works again on the solution ending with the next presentation. Per dot voting the group picks the best solution.
Iterate as much as possible. Throw away your prototypes. Look for alternatives, follow The Rule of Three (A good decision is one for which you have evaluated three alternatives)

In order , write detailed scenarios with objectives and design screens on a whiteboard.

Idea solution found: converge it by wiritng an elevator pitch, product vision canvas, check it by 360 view (UX, technology, business value)
usefull tools to get feedback from others and to ask/revise yourself whether you are on track, e.g. do we create any business value, to we differinate from others.....




after you got a "go" create impact mapping
user story map from your scenarios

Create first user story map with notes for your scenarios. Repeat it with other scenarios, other personas, think about scenario variations. Add all information to current user story map or create seperate ones (depending on size, complexity).

4. Sort your result and collect items which a required for a first *MVP* (Minimal Viable Product)



5. Write down a vision of your product (Elevator Pitch, Product Vision Board, Innovation Board, Newspaper-Cover-Page). During the workshop or afterwards. Prepare it and the group should review it, collect the feedback and incorporate it to, clarify missunderstanding, different opinions.

### ToDo:




Preparation: be prepared. Easiest way is to perform the workshop on your own: Do some brainstorming/solostorming on your own, create a first user story map, a first persona, .... Every output must not be perfect, it only serves your preparation.
