# Ideation:

## Design-Thinking-"Light"-Workshop:

### Before you start
Try to get as much information (by interviewing, observation, do it on you own, ask any export) about the topic, people, project and problems - just collect it.

Preparation: be prepared. Easiest way is to perform the workshop on your own: Do some brainstorming/solostorming on your own, create a first user story map, a first persona, .... Every output must not be perfect, it only serves your preparation.

### Workshop

#### Start with How-Might-We-Question

Try to find an appropriate balance between open and focused. It should not be to narrow but not to wide. Hard task as question is quite important for the whole workshop. But be patient, you can change it during the process and with the help of your team.  

Before the workshop try to get feedback about your HMW-Question.

#### Team
Find a heterogeneous team: Product Owner, Engagement Manager, Tester, Developer, Business Analyst, Customer, people from outside (other projects, similar projects)

#### Workshop-Steps
1. Do a *brainstorming* for the most important terms of the HMW-Question.
After the brainstorming cluster the results in groups, like constraints, objectives,  technology, customer. Afterwards add prios and remove nonsense.
2. *Summarize* your results:
Do you find „a problem“, „The problem!“. Good ideas need always a problem to solve. In case you got it,  take it and find a solution for this problem.
In case a idea pops up in your head, try to identify the problem for this idea. Is it a problem? Discuss it in your group.
3. In order to *embellish your idea* create a persona/empathy map for a person who owns the problem, write detailed scenarios with objectives and design screens on a whiteboard.
Create first user story map with notes for your scenarios. Repeat it with other scenarios, other personas, think about scenario variations. Add all information to current user story map or create seperate ones (depending on size, complexity).
4. Sort your result and collect items which a required for a first *MVP* (Minimal Viable Product)

  For the ideation you could apply one of following methods or combinations.
  -	Brainstorming
  -	Power of ten: Exaggerate and go underneath?
  -	Mindmapping
  -	Pessimist vs optimist: Start a conservation between optimist and pessimist.
  -	Randomnes: take your topic plus any other, random thing/object. Describe "thing" with adjectives or associations, combine them together to your topic
  -	Set constraints: Wie würde das die Konkurennz machen? Was wäre wenn wir in der Küche sind? Was würde Superman machen? Wir haben unendlich Geld?
  -	Ask your self: What does not make sense? Try ti identify problems of the daily process
  -	Distribution: what ...happens ...in case (not)....
  -	Question the question (5-whys): Try to find the real problem behind the problem....
  -	As-Is Personas plus As-Is User journey

  Iterate as much as possible. Throw away your prototypes. Look for alternatives, follow The Rule of Three (A good decision is one for which you have evaluated three alternatives)

5. Write down a vision of your product (Elevator Pitch, Product Vision Board, Innovation Board, Newspaper-Cover). During the workshop or afterwards. Prepare it and the group should review it, collect the feedback and incorporate it to, clarify missunderstanding, different opinions.

### ToDo:

Öffnen und Schließen

### Rules (Brainstorming):
- be visual
- one conversation at a time
- encourage wild ideas
- defer judgement
- go for quantity
- build on the ideas of others
- Do not judge! Support by „yes, and…“
- Mistakes are allowed!
- Fail fast
