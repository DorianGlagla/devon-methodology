=== Business Component BCO_User_Management ===

image::{imagesUserManagement}business_component_user_management.svg[]

The business componente BCO_User_Management encapsulates the service functionality necessary to manage users and roles of users.

It will not contain client use cases: The interaction between the client and these services is so atomic, that
it will be documented in the dialogue description itself.


==== Service Use Case "UC_Manage_User" ====


[cols="v,v" options=compact]
|====
2+| This servcice use case allows the management of a user: to find a user, to save a user and to delete a user. It is used via the external interface +EIF_Manage_User+.
_This is a a trivial use case._
|Actors | ACR_System_MyThaiStar
|Usage |Automatic
|Precondition |
- *Find user* The search criteria for an order are transmitted in IET_Find_User.
- *Save user* The data to save an order are transmitted in IET_Save_User
- *Delete user* The order id transmitted in IET_Delete_User
|====

.Standard workflow: Find user
. The application searches for a user matching all search criteria provided in +IET_Find_User+. Most often, only the email address will be used.
. It creates a paginated list of the users it found and returns it as IET_Paginated_List_of_Users. Most often, this will be only one user.
. It provides the list as a result of the use case.

.Alternative workflow: Save user
. The system converts IET_Save_User to ETY_User.
. The system stores ETY_User to the database.

.Alternative workflow: Delete user
. The system searches for an ETY_User using IAT_User_ID.
. The system deletes ETY_User.
