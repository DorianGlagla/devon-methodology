= Specification of the _<Project_Name>_ Application =

NOTE: *_Handling of notes_*: _Content inside tags like <Project_Name> should be changed by your
own project's information. additionally, delete all the tips before generating your document._

NOTE: *_Content of a specification_*: _A specification contains a formalized desciption of the currently implemented portion of the application. While a story or epic describes necessary implementations to be done in the future, a specification describes the system as a whole in the current implementation state._

[NOTE]
====
*_Formality of the artifacts_*: _The contents of a system are described in the form of focused and formalized artifacts (e.g. use cases, entities, interfaces). This is done in order to_

- _reduce the complexity of the description._
- _reduce the redundancy of the description and therefore contradictions._
- _increase the level of detail and therefore the correctness per artifact._

_The artifacts will in many cases directly relate to the implementation, e.g. business components to packages, use cases to classes, entities to tables. Therefore, this structure enables the establishment of a ubiquitous language in the tradition of domain driven design._
====

[NOTE]
====
*_Usage of prefixes_*: _The artifacts (use cases, screens, interfaces, ...) of a specification shall be given a unique name (without spaces) prefixed by the type of the artifact, e.g. "ETY_Guest_Personal_Data" for an artifact of the type "Entity", where each instance of the entity contains the personal data of one guest._

.The following entity types are typically used:
- _ACO: An APPLICATION COMPONENT, a (mostly) independent part of the functionality of an application, e.g. "ACO_Customer_Management", "ACO_Invoice_Handling"_
- _UC: A USE CASE describing the functionality of an application, grouped in application components._
- _ACT: An ACTOR using a use case, invoking an interface etc. May be human or automated._
- _AFU: An APPLCATION FUNCTION. While a use case is typically invoked or used by an actor, an application function is a part of the logic of a use case isolated in a seperate function in order to reduce redundancy or the complexity of use cases. Use Case Functions are often called more than once within a single UseCase._
- _BAT: A BATCH is invoked in defined intervals (minutes, months, years) to perform functionality on a large amount of data, e.g. deleting obsolete data.
- _MCO: A MODEL COMPONENT: Entities are grouped in model components. Each model component is controlled by exactly one application component. Most often, these components correspond to each other._
- _ETY: An ENTITY containing (most often persisted) information (see Chapter "Data Model")_
- _ATT: An ATTRIBUTE inside an entity. It contains a name, a type, a description and information about its multiplicity._
- _DTY: The DATA TYPE of an attribute inside an entity._
- _DIA: A DIALOGUE FLOW, typically supporting the functionality of a use case._
- _SCR: A SCREEN inside a DIALOGUE FLOW, representing one page or one state of a page._
- _PRI: A formatted PRINTOUT. Also used to define the structure of input data._
- _EIF: An EXTERNAL INTERFACE of the system, either providing a service or using an external service._
- _EIE: An ENTITY of an EXTERNAL INTERFACE, analogous to an entity of the data model._
- _EIA: An ATTRIBUTE of an EXTERNAL INTERFACE._
- _NFR: A NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT of the system._

_The usage of unique names without spaces and of these prefixes for artifacts allows to directly identify an artifact and its type._
====

[NOTE]
====
*_Naming:_* _All Artifacts except components, entities and attributes (both in the data model and in interfaces) should be named with a verb followed by a noun, e.g._ DIA_Manage_User_

_Entities (both for the data model and for interfaces shall be named after the contents of a single instance of the entitiy. E.g., an entity containing all users of the system should be called ETY_User,_ *_not_* _ETY_Users, ETY_User_Directory or something similar._

_Attributes shall also be named according to a single value of the attribute, even if they are multi-valued. E.g., a multi-valued attribute for telephone numbers shall be named ATT_Telephone_Number,_ *_not_* _ATT_Telephone_Numbers._

_Components (both for use cases and for the data model) shall not contain verbs, but describe the contents. E.g. BCO_Business_Log_Management._

_A few artifacts will not fit into this schema.For these, exceptions shall be made._

== Introduction ==

_The first sections should provide an overview of the application and of the important concepts used in these applications. This information should enable the reader to comprehend the different artifacts that are described after that._

NOTE: *_Purpose of the chapter_*: _This chapter must provide the context to understand the very specific artifacts (use cases, entities) defined in the following chapters. All cross cutting concepts should be defined here or in the appendix (and then be referenced here)._

NOTE: *_Structure_*: _There are no rules for the structure of the introductory chapters. The focus should be to present the context with as much didactics as possible._

The <Project_Name> application allows users to:

_<List below the basic functionalities that your application implements for your customer or user>_

- _<Explain Functionality>_
- _<Explain Functionality>_
- _<Explain Functionality>_
- _<Explain Functionality>_


=== Architectural overview ===

_Describe a brief architectural overview._

[NOTE]
====
*_Goal of the architectural overview:_* _The architectural overview describes the integration of the specified application into the application landscape of the customer. It identifies the neighboring systems and displays their interfaces. The application is briefly described with its different business components. This can be visualized by using a component diagram._

_The architectural overview should be brief and clearly structured. A good overview diagram will show the placement of the application and will provide an impression of the complexity of the project._

== Use Cases ==
_This chapter contains the definition of the business logic of the application. The business logic is split into business components. Each business component contains the use cases, use case functions and the batches of this business component._

=== Actors ===

_This chapter contains the actors using your application. They may be e.g. technical systems or organizational units. The benefit of defining actors is to use them in use cases, dialogues and interfaces to uniformly define who interacts with the system in what manner._

NOTE: *_Actors and roles_*: _Actors do not equal roles (in the context of access control). Actors simply define the different organizational or business contexts in which the business logic is used. The roles and authorizations are defined separately, most often as part of the appendix._

NOTE: *_Actors and tools_*: _If an actor uses a tool to access the system (like a browser or a client), the actor is still the user and not the tool he used. The modeling of human actors should be preferred._

NOTE: *_Granularity of actors_*: _Do not define actors in a granularity that is too fine. Group very detailed organizational units if their interaction with the system is uniform. Use the actor description to define the underlying organizational units, and actors themselves to define the different kinds of interaction with the system._

=== Business Component BCO_<Component_Name>_<Action_Name> ===

[NOTE]
====
*_Business Components_*: _The business logic of an application is typically quite complex. In order to specify and implement it in a sustainable way, the business logic needs to be structured. As a first step, different areas of functionality that are largely independent from each other are identified. These areas shall be business components. In the implemented system, functionality of one component may only access the functionality of other components using well defined interfaces. This keeps a growing complexity at bay and allows for a focused definition of the functionality._


_Examples for business components could be business logging, printout creation, order handling or user administration._
====

NOTE: *_Business components and data_*: _Typically, a business component controls a number of entities in the database (the entities of a corresponding_ *_model component_*). _This data is only written (and in many cases only read) by the functionality of the business component. This is called the secrecy principle of a business component: Only the component itself knows about the details of its functionality and its data, making the whole application thereby easier to maintain._

NOTE: *_Use case diagram_*: _For each component, a use case diagram should be used to give an overview of all use cases of the component and the relationship between the actors and the use cases._


image::business_component_ComponentName_management.svg[caption="Figure 2: ", title="Business Component _<Component_Name>_ <Action_Name>", alt="Business Component _<Component_Name>_ <Action_Name>"]

_Explain here your component and its functionality_

_You should explain each use case defined on your use case diagram._

==== Service Use Case "UC_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name>" ====

NOTE: *_Use Cases_*: _The functionality of a business component is still too complex to be defined in one artifact. Therefore, independent parts of the functionality need to be identified. Typically, this is done by identifying different ways to interact with the system. Roughly put, each usage pattern of the system that provides a benefit for a (potentially non-human) actor may be a_ *_use case_* _of the system._

NOTE: *_Client and service use cases_*: _The business logic is divided between the logic present in the services and the logic present in the client. If the logic implemented in the client is more complex than the dialogue flow, a simple service call or a confirmation dialogue, the logic may also be defined in a use case or a use case function (see below). We differentiate between use cases in the client and service use cases using the stereotypes Client UC and Service UC._

[NOTE]
====
*_Use cases and use case functions_*: _As described above, a use case typically represents an interaction with the system that in itself provides a benefit for the actor. In some situations, part of the logic of a use case is defined in a_ use case function, _that is used by the use case. This is done if_

- _the use case is complex and it is necessary to reduce its complexity._
- _the part of the use case is used often and shall be implemented only once._

_A use case function is defined just like a normal use case, but without the naming of an actor: This use case is not used by an actor, but is invoked by another use case function or another use case._
====

[NOTE]
====
*_Granularity of use cases and use case steps:_* _Do not define the use cases on a very fine granularity: E.g., do not create one use case to search for a customer per search criterion. Instead, create one use case with different input data or different scenarios for different criteria. Otherwise, the use cases will contain many equal steps, which will over time differ and create an inconsistent system._

_Be careful concerning the level of detail for the individual use case steps. Functionality like the general validation of input data could also be specified in the datatypes or in a cross sectional section._
====

[NOTE]
====
*_standard workflow and alternative workflow_*: _Special cases during the execution of complex use cases should not be addressed too early. This can be achieved by describing the standard workflow and its steps first and describing alternative workflows with references to the according steps in the standard workflow afterwards. Defining alternative workflows is optional._

TIP:  Do not forget small and atomic use cases. These need to be implemented and therefore named here. For instance, manage order contains: find order, save order and delete order.

TIP: Very complex use cases with a large number of steps involved can be visualized by using a UML activity diagram which contains all the steps and all the use case functions called.

==== Batch "UC_Create_<Component_Name>" ====

NOTE: *_Batches_*: _Aside from user interaction via the GUI or the automatic interfaces, business logic is also executed in the form of a regularly or ad-hoc executed batch. A batch typically handles a larger amount of data sets, e.g. sending reminders or deleting obsolete data sets. Batches are modeled similar to use cases, but have slightly different metadata (e.g. configuration, dependencies, data volume)._

== Data Model ==
// tag::DataModel[]

NOTE: *_Data Model_*: _The data model describes the business-view of the data of the system. large data models are split into different model components. These model components do not overlap so that each entity type belongs to exactly one model component._

NOTE: *_Data types_*: _The data model has its focus on the business view of the application. It is not necessary that the data types correspond to those used in application code. Instead we use more generic data types such as "date", "text", "number". If the data type is not self-explanatory and relevant to one of the specified business functions, describe it in detail in a table below the data model._

_<This chapter contains the data model of the application.>_

TIP: This data model is primarily defined by diagrams. Textual documentation
is added for the entity types, attributes and relations, for which the diagrams
are not sufficient as documentation. This should be the exception

TIP: There is not only a data model for data stored in a database. If necessary,
transient internal data models may also be defined in this chapter.


=== Model Component MCO_<Component_Name> ===
_<Insert here a diagram explaining the data model of your component. It is normally
 a class diagram that defines the attributes of each component and the entities
 involved. See below an example.>_

image::mco_ComponentName.svg[caption="Figure 3: ", title="Model Component MCO_<Component_Name>", alt="Model Component MCO_<Component_Name>"]

TIP: Use the sufix ATT_ for defining attributes, entities with ETY_ and MCO_ for model components.

_<List below the entities shown on the diagram:>_

NOTE: *_Omitting entity types_*: _Not every entity type has to be described in detail. Their name , their attributes as well as their relations to other entities should already be described in the UML diagram of the component. Use additional descriptions only if necessary._

NOTE: *_Attribute description_*: _Each attribute and its data type should already be visualized in one of the component models. Therefore it is not necessary to describe each attribute in detail. Nevertheless, some attributes make an additional explanation necessary (for example when using non-standard data types with business relevance). In this case, an additional table with attribute-name, data-type and description should be used._

==== Entity Type ETY_<Entity_Name1> ====
_<Explain here the attributes of this entity, what encapsulates and in which case it is needed.>_

==== Entity Type ETY_<Entity_Name2> ====
_<Explain here the attributes of this entity, what encapsulates and in which case it is needed.>_

== Dialogues ==

[NOTE]
====
*_Dialogues and screens_*: _A "dialogue" defines the whole user interface used by a use case (screens, states, transitions). The description of the dialogue should if possible be self-containing and not rely on other dialogues._

_A "screen" is a screen area necessary to perform a steps of a use-case, e.g. a window or a (part of a) web page. A single page application may be specified in different screens depending on the state it is in._
====

_<This chapter contains the description of the user interface.>_

_<List below all the dialogues of your application.>_

- *_<Dialogue_Name>_* _<Describe briefly the dialogue.>_
- *_<Dialogue_Name>_* _<Describe briefly the dialogue.>_
- *_<Dialogue_Name>_* _<Describe briefly the dialogue.>_
- *_<Dialogue_Name>_* _<Describe briefly the dialogue.>_

NOTE: *_Client flows:_* _The client flows are specified as dialogues and screens. Dialogues contain the flow between the screens. In current clients, the same screens are used in very different forms for different purposes. In this case, one "dialogue screen" may be represented in multiple screens in the documentation._


=== Cross sectional: Dialogue areas and mechanisms ===

_This chapter contains cross-sectional elements and mechanisms of the client. Cross-sectional topics do not need to be documented for each screen. They can be documented in this section before the different dialogues._

=== Dialogue DIA_<Dialogue_Name> ===


_The dialogue flow should be presented in an image like the following._

image::DIA_Main_Screen_and_User_Management.svg[caption="Figure 3: ", title="DIA_<Dialogue_Name>", alt="DIA_<Dialogue_Name>"]

_Briefly explain the purpose of this dialogue. Describe the dependencies between the screens and the possibilities to navigate between them._


NOTE: Not every dialogue has to be documented in the same way, it will depend on what you think is important.


==== Screen SCR_<Screen_Name> ====

_Describe the goal of the screen in very few sentences._

[NOTE]
====
*_References to the data model:_* _If it is helpful, describe the relationship between a screen and the entities of the data model in a_

[NOTE]
====
*_Mockups and screenshots:_* _The screens can be documented mostly by mockups or screenshots. The different elements of the screens need to be documented if they are not self explanatory or invoke any kind of business functionality._

image::SCR_User_Login.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title="Screen SCR_<Screen_Name>: Screenshot", alt="Screen SCR_<Screen_Name>: Screenshot"]
====

_Describe the elements of the screen that are not self explanatory. There are no rules for the description._

NOTE: *_business logic in screens:_* _Very limited business logic can be defined directly in the screen (e.g. a verification dialogue or a very simple call to a service). For other logic a use case or use case function should be referenced._

== Printouts ==
_Use this section if you are either creating complex formatted printouts, or if you have to define the structure of formatted input data that is not externally defined. Otherwise, delete it._


[NOTE]
====
*_External definition:_* _The definition of printout will typically happen in an external document (e.g. a spreadsheet or a Word/Writer document). This section contains sections for each printout._

_In these sections, the goal of the different workouts are defined. Additionally, the external documents containing the detailed definitions are referenced._
====

=== Printout PRI_Reminder_Email_2_Weeks_Notice ===

== External Interfaces ==
// tag::ExternalInterfaces[]
_This section defines_ *_provided_* _external interfaces of the system itself that provide functionality as well as_ *_required_* _external interfaces necessary for the functionality of the system._

[NOTE]
====
*_Level of detail:_* _Do not define an external interface, if it is already defined elsewhere. This includes rather technical documentation like xml schemas or swagger docs. There should be one source of truth for the external interfaces._

_If an external documentation exists, simply describe the goal of the interface and reference the external document. Even detailed diagrams should be omitted._
====

=== Provided external interfaces ===

==== External Interface EIF_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name> ====
_This section defines external interfaces required by the application or provided by the application._

NOTE: *_Technical interfaces:_* _All services provided and required by the server application are documented here. If services
are quite simple like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) services, they will be defined in diagrams alone.
Additional documentation is supplied where needed._

_Insert here a diagram describing the external interfaces like the example showed below._

image::eif_manage_ComponentName.svg[caption="Figure 4: ", title="External Interface EIF_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name>", alt="External Interface EIF_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name>"]

This external interface provides the following operations using the different
interface entity types:

- _<Operation 1>_: See UC_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name>, Scenario _<Event_Name1>_ .
- _<Operation 2>_: See UC_<Action_Name>_<Component_Name>, Scenario _<Event_Name2>_ .
