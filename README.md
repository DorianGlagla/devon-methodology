# Devon Methodology



# Introduction

The purpose of this space is to give an overview of the Devon methodology and how we can apply the Accelerated Solution Design practices to model and build the solution with the use of Devon framework.

# Accelerated Solution Design

The ASD is carefully designed to be a practical guideline that fosters and ensures the collaboration and communication among all team members.
The members of the team involved in the ASD will be:
  - Customer.
  - Studio members, made up of UX Designer, Business Analyst and Architect.
  - Yard members, made up of Developers.

The Accelerated Solution Design introduces a new type of team, which is broader, flexible and self-organized:
  - The span of the team is broader, since clients are considered an important part of the team, a partner indeed. Customers shall have an active role in defining the user needs and validating the assumptions. In fact, they shall be consulted throughout the whole design and development processes.
  - The team shall be flexible enough to adapt to unexpected changes, such as new requirements or the introduction of more roles in the development of the solution.
 - Finally, each team member shall be self-organized. In other words, self-aware of their capacity and area of responsibility, able to organize their work and committed to ensure an efficient communication within the team.

# Showcases

We will introduce the required techniques, practices and methologies with two showcases:
- [Jump the Queue](https://github.com/devonfw/devon-methodology/blob/master/references/JumpTheQueue/JumpTheQueue). Sample application to offer companies and institutions to offer people a jumpstart in a ticket queue.

- [My Thai Star](https://github.com/devonfw/devon-methodology/blob/master/references/JumpTheQueue/MyThaiStar). Sample application that supports the online presence of the MyThaiStar restaurant.
