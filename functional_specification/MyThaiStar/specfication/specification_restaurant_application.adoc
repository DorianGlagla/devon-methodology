*Standard workflow*

. The user chooses to assign a table (TODO: Ref. to datamodel)
. The system reads and presents a list of the currently active waiters ( <<ETYStaffMember, StaffMember>> with role "waiter") and proposes to the user to cancel the assignment, to delete the current assignment or to assign a waiter. The deletion of an assignment is only proposed if a waiter is currently assigned to the table.
. If the user cancelles the assignment: The system returns to the previous screen without changes. The use case is finished.
. If the user deletes the current assignment of a waiter:
.. The system removes the assigned waiter form the current table.
.. The system shows the updated contents of the previous screen.
. If the user selects a waiter and assigns him to the table:
.. The system stores the ID of the waiter for the current table.
.. The system returns to the previous screen
. The use case is finished
